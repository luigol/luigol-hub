# 🌌 Luigol Hub 

**Luigol Hub** is my central space on the web, a **custom Linktree** hosted on GitHub Pages.  
Here I share my story, gather my main links, and — most importantly — make my **first design tests** for **Mymory**, a future social network based on connections and interactive bubbles.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create a **personal hub**, simple and elegant, to gather my links (YouTube, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
- Explore **interface designs** that will later be used in **Mymory**.
- Test **navigation flow** and **Glassmorphism-based components**.

---

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

- **Background theme:** black (`#0a0a0a`).
- **Interactive elements** (buttons, popups, menus, selectors):
  - **Glassmorphism style** → `backdrop-filter: blur(...)` + translucent borders.
  - Smooth **hover effects** and **shadows** for depth.
- **Typography:** [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter), clean and modern.
- **Layout:** minimalist, centered, focused on storytelling.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **HTML5** and **CSS3** (pure, no frameworks).
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for:
  - Dynamic translation (PT/EN/ES).
  - Language control with `localStorage`.
  - Menu interactivity.
